		 <p>(Horton) 
		 I've been guarding this clover for over a week 
		 Getting laughed at for thinking a dust speck can speak 
		 Well, let them all laugh 
		 I'll try not to mind 
		 For I have found something that they'll never find </p>

		 <p>There are secrets on a leaf, in the water, in the air <br>
		 Hidden planets, tiny worlds, all invisible <br>
		 Not a person seems to know, not a person seems to care <br>
		 There is no one who believes a thing I say <br>
		 Well, I'm fairly certain that at one time or other <br>
		 Great thinkers all feel this way </p>

		 <p>I'm alone in the universe <br>
		 So alone in the universe <br>
		 I found magic, but they don't see it <br>
		 They all call me a lunatic, okay, call me a lunatic <br>
		 If I stand on my own, so be it <br>
		 Because I have wings, yes I can fly <br>
		 Around the moon and far beyond the sky <br>
		 And one day soon I know there will be <br>
		 One small voice in the universe <br>
		 One true friend in the universe <br>
		 Who believes in me </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 I'm alone in the universe 
		 So alone in the universe 
		 My own planets and stars are glowing </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Alone in the universe </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 No one notices anything 
		 Not one person is listening 
		 They don't have any way of knowing </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Nobody knows <em>THAT</em> I have wings </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 I have wings </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 And I can fly </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 I can fly </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Around the moon </p>

		 <p>(Both) 
		 And far beyond the sky 
		 Well someday soon 
		 You will hear my <em>PLEA</em> </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 One small voice in the universe </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 One true friend in the universe </p>

		 <p>(Both) 
		 Please believe in me </p>

		 <p><em>spoken</em> 
		 (Horton) 
		 Hello? Hello? </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 Hello? <em>(GASP)</em> </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Who's there? </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 It's me, JoJo, the mayor's son! </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Oh, I'm Horton, the elephant. </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 Are you real, or are you a very large think? </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Oh I'm real all right, I would state that in ink. </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 In my thinks, I imagine a lot of strange things, 
		 And I go to strange places 
		 As if I had wings! 
		 I love a good think! </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Well for me that goes double. </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 Sometimes my thinks are what get me in trouble. </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 When you think, do you dream? </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 In bright colors! </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Oh, me too! 
		 And I go to strange places like Solla Sollew! </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 When you think, do you think you can fly with the stars? </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Oh little friend, no one else can have thinks such as ours! </p>

		 <p><em>sung</em> 
		 Yes I have wings </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 I have wings </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 And I can fly </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 I can fly </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 Around the moon </p>

		 <p>(Both) 
		 And far beyond the sky </p>

		 <p>(Horton) 
		 You called my name and you set me free 
		 One small voice in the universe </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 One true friend in the universe </p>

		 <p>(Both) 
		 Who believes in me </p>

		 <p><em>spoken</em> 
		 (Horton) 
		 Good night, JoJo. </p>

		 <p>(JoJo) 
		 Good night Horton, see you in Solla Sollew...</p>
