    <h1>The Difference Engine</h1>
    <p>The Difference Engine was designed by Charles Babbage.  During his time, women were hired to write mathematical books ((BOOKS OF WHAT?)).  Babbage noticed that there were many errors within the books and that if the books were created by machines, the books would contain less mistakes.  So he decided to do that, make a machine that would get rid of the need for humans ot manually write out the mathematical books.  (Connor help with the wording please.  I see words, but they don't make sense.)</p>
    <p>Though he finished the design for the Difference Engine easily, the problem came when the physical model was being made.  It took too many resources (silver and metal).  When Babbage tried to get more funding, he was declined.  So he was only able to make one pillar of the great Difference Engine.</p>
    <p>Recently, a very wealthy person ((WHO)) wanted the Difference Engine to be physically made, so he funded a project to create it.  The original design was so amazing, there were around twelve modifications people from the current time had to make. ((HOW IS THIS AMAZING?))</p>
